# PISA

PINGU Simulation and Analysis (PISA) is software written for performing analyses based upon Monte Carlo simulations of the [IceCube neutrino observatory](https://icecube.wisc.edu/), including the [DeepCore](https://arxiv.org/abs/1109.6096) and proposed [PINGU](https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.2046) low-energy in-fill arrays (as well as other similar neutrino detectors).

PISA was originally developed to cope with low-statistics Monte Carlo (MC) for PINGU using parameterizations of the MC, but its methods should apply equally as well to high-MC situations, and the PISA architecture is general enough to easily accomoodate traditional reweighted-MC-style analyses.
